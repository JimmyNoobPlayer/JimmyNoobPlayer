Intereseted in...
using artificial intelligence to understand humans. Identifying pictures, understanding text, and playing very complex games
well are human tasks that are done in somewhat human-like ways. AIs sometimes appear to be treated like slaves, they should
be tutors and poets. Also not crutches or exoskeletons that encourage natural human thought to decay into distracted flailings.

I wrote that paragraph before ChatGPT became popular. AlphaGo and other game-trained AIs play the game the way a human
would, being trained to win a game. ChatGPT is fundamentally different, it's not trained to investigate, share information,
debate, or present beautiful art, it is designed to mimic humans that are doing that. It is only valuable to people who cannot
directly comprehend the value of art and wish to copy preexisting art without crediting the authors. It's possible AI art might
be useful for something more than placeholders in the future, but only if we develop techniqes to train AI beyond mere mimicry.

In the comments for a YouTube Go learning video for channel Go Magic, I wrote, "The 'best move' is only the best if you have
perfect execution at every point of the game, and many AI-determined "best moves" seem to thrust the game into a state of
confusion no human can understand. Are there AI tools that have a focus on explaining the state of the game in human
terms, instead of 'this move is 78%, this move is 79%.' ?"

The video creator replied, "Nope, there are no such tools atm." 2024.

The people who are creating AI programs are failing the human race due to lack of imagination.
They can only think of tricks to take money from other people, and that is all they are attempting to create.
