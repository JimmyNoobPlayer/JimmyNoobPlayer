- 👋 Hi, I’m @JimmyNoobPlayer
I go by James with just about everyone but I like the cute childish version of my name I haven't seriously used for decades.
It helps me forget I'm rushing towards death and helps me project a safe appealing front. The full name is based on the
Magic Psychographic cards: Timmy, Power Gamer; Johnny, Combo Player; and Spike, Tournament Grinder. At one point I played
Magic the Gathering regularly and read all of Mark Rosewater's articles.
- 👀 I’m interested in ...

well are human tasks that are done in somewhat human-like ways. AIs sometimes appear to be treated like slaves, they should
be tutors and poets. Also not crutches or exoskeletons that encourage natural human thought to decay into distracted flailings.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
the most basic-bitch dumb artificial intelligence stuff you can find in a hundred web tutorials. Keras in python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
